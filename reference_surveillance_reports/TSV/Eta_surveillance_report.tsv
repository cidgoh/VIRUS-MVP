(2021)	https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1922097		This mutation presents mainly within the B.1 (44.0%) and B.1.525 (38.1%) lineages.  Currently, 99.7% of the B.1.525 lineage isolates carry the M:I82T mutation. While this mutation is scattered across multiple  phylogenetic clades, most cases cluster in two recent clades, suggesting a likely selective advantage in certain haplotype backgrounds.
